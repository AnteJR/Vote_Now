![Vote Now!](README_Materials/Title.gif)

***Vote Now!*** is a game created in the context of a university programming class called "2D Video Games", supervised by Isaac Pante at the University of Lausanne. In this course, we learned to use [KaboomJS](https://kaboomjs.com/), which I am using for this project.

The game is available on [itch.io](https://jrante.itch.io/vote-now)and [GitHub Pages](https://antejr.github.io/Vote_Now/) !

***Vote Now!*** is a minimalist strategy game. The premise of the game is that you play as a political party aiming to pass a bill in Switzerland by propagandizing to influence voters' opinions. The game plays kind of like [Reigns](https://store.steampowered.com/app/474750/Reigns/), as in you have a choice of 2 actions that you can pick from at a time. The game works using 3 main variables:

* **Money.** This determines if you can buy campaign materials. It can be earned by asking for donations from voters or sponsors.
* **Votes.** This determines how much in your favor the vote is going. From 0 (no voting intentions in your favor) to 100 (all voting intentions to your favor), it will be influenced by purchasing add-space, distributing flyers and organizing events.
* **Optics.** This determines if your party's image is in good shape or not. It is a modifier to the votes you get. This means that if you have 1.1 optics, it will add 1.1x the amount of votes you would normally get.
